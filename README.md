# badminton_ML_project
Using a Multi-Layer Perceptron and Convolutional Neural Network to classify different shot types in still images of badminton rallies. The code for the MLP is found under badminton_MLP.ipynb, and similarly the code for the CNN is found under badminton_CNN.ipynb. 

This project was done as part of Aalto University's CS-C3240 Machine Learning course. The final project report can be found as a PDF titled 'Machine Learning Project - Classifying Badminton Images using MLP and CNN.'
